# Brazilian-E-Commerce-Public-Dataset-by-Olist
Olist is a Brazilian e-commerce platform that connects small and medium-sized businesses to customers across Brazil. The platform operates as a marketplace, where merchants can list their products and services and customers can browse and purchase them online.
Overview 

We conducted thorough data exploration and supplemented our information by reviewing insights from the companyâ€™s website, newspaper and economic websites from Brazil to gain a comprehensive understanding of the current market landscape surrounding the company. Our fundamental analysis revealed that Olist operates within a diverse yet competitive market environment which is the e-commerce. While the company has experienced notable successes, we identified potential challenges, including stagnation in sales for specific products. To validate this observation, we plan to cross-reference our findings with the database and conduct in-depth analyses in Power BI of sales patterns across various regions, sellers, and orders. 

Plan of action 

In this project, with a use of Microsoft Power BI tool, a presented dashboards that summarizes the company in terms of the sales, customers, products and products performance. As well as descriptive, clustering analysis and forecasting analysis. 

Key Assumptions & Constraints on the project.  

The pivotal assumption in this project is that the information provided suggests that the variable "freight" represents transportation costs (logistics cost), while "price" denotes the product cost. Consequently, profit was calculated as the disparity between the sum of price and freight and total payments (revenue).
